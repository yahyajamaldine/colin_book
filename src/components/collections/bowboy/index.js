<p>[I]t recounts the adventures of Harold, a complete innocent, at the hands of the sophisticated, bright, and wealthy folk of New York.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this instance, the painter, uncharacteristically, has followed the description of the characters as it is set down in the novel, but he has done much more than that. By employing curious symbols, he has brought about an interrelation between the plates. Admirably, then, as these drawings serve to illustrate my book, they also excellently play an independent drama of their own.</p>
